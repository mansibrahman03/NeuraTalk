AI Chatbot Assistant

Project Overview: A natural language processing chatbot built with PyTorch and NLTK that understands user queries and responds with appropriate answers.

Features:
- Intent Recognition: Classifies user input into predefined categories using a neural network
- Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization and lemmatization
- Custom Function Mappings: Trigger specific functions based on recognized intents
- Persistent Model: Save and load trained models for continued use
Configurable Training: Adjustable batch size, learning rate, and epochs

Technical Implementation:
The chatbot leverages several NLP and machine learning techniques:
- Bag of Words: Converts text inputs into numerical features
- Neural Network: 3-layer architecture with ReLU activation
- Dropout Regularization: Prevents overfitting during training
- Cross-Entropy Loss: Optimizes classification performance

Project Structure:
- ChatbotModel: PyTorch neural network architecture
- ChatbotAssistant: Main class handling processing and responses
- Training pipeline with data preparation and model optimization
- Inference system for processing user messages

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- NumPy

Future Improvements:
- Implement more advanced NLP techniques (word embeddings, transformers)
- Add conversation context tracking
- Expand function mappings for more interactive capabilities
- Improve confidence threshold handling for intent classification
